String concatenation	//adding strings together
"Hello," + " New York City"
'Hello, New York City'

"hello" + "world"	//spacing is not automatic
'helloworld'

"Hello + 5*10"	
'Hello + 5*10'	

"Hello" + 5*10 	//implicit type coercion in JavaScript. 
'Hello50'	//multiplies the 5*10 to 50 which is changed into the string "50", This then gets combined with the string "Hello".

Variables	//Storing the value of a string in a variable is like packing it away for later use.

let call = "Hello"

call + " Priscah"
'Hello Priscah'

call + " World"
'Hello World'

call = " aloha"		// reassigning a new string value to the variable
' aloha'
call + " Priscah"
' aloha Priscah'

uses camelCase if the variable name is multiple words and lowercase if the variable name is one word
