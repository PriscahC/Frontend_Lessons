        <p>A utopia typically describes an imaginary community or society that possesses highly desirable or nearly perfect qualities 
            for its members.[1] It was coined by Sir Thomas More for his 1516 book Utopia, describing a fictional island society in the 
            New World. However, it may also denote an intentional community. In common parlance, the word or its adjectival form may be 
            used synonymously with "impossible", "far-fetched" or "deluded". <br/>
            Hypothetical utopias focus on—amongst other things—equality, in such categories as economics, government and justice, with the 
            method and structure of proposed implementation varying based on ideology.[2] Lyman Tower Sargent argues that the nature of a 
            utopia is inherently contradictory because societies are not homogeneous and have desires which conflict and therefore cannot 
            simultaneously be satisfied.</p>

        <p class="p3">The Alps[a] are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe,[b][2] stretching approximately 
            750 mi (1,210 km) across eight Alpine countries (from west to east): France, Switzerland, Monaco, Italy, Liechtenstein, Austria, 
            Germany, and Slovenia.[3] <br/>
            <span>The Alpine arch generally extends from Nice on the western Mediterranean to Trieste on the Adriatic and Vienna at the beginning of
                the Pannonian Basin. The mountains were formed over <br/> tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. 
                Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks 
                such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn.
                Mont Blanc spans the French–Italian border, and at 4,809 m (15,778 ft) is the highest <br/> mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area 
                contains 128 peaks higher than 4,000 m (13,000 ft).</span></p>

                This paragraph has an image that is floated to the <strong>left.</strong> 
                It is highly recommended to add a margin to images so that the text does 
                not get too close to the image. If you want your text to be easily read, you 
                should always add a few pixels between words and borders, images, 
                and other content.

            The value scroll results in clipped overflow, but a scrollbar is added, so the rest of the content may be seen. We set a specific 
            height and width for the div element, and as you can see, 
            the content cannot fit.
